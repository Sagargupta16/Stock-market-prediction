## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements an LSTM-based neural network to predict stock prices using historical market data. The model is trained on data from four major tech stocks: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Tesla (TSLA).

### Key Features

- **Multi-stock prediction**: Supports prediction for multiple stocks simultaneously
- **LSTM neural network**: Utilizes deep learning for time series forecasting
- **Real-time data fetching**: Uses Yahoo Finance API for up-to-date stock data
- **Comprehensive visualization**: Includes actual vs predicted price comparisons
- **Technical analysis**: Moving averages and feature importance analysis
- **Performance metrics**: Mean Squared Error evaluation for model accuracy

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

```bash
pip install yfinance pandas torch scikit-learn matplotlib numpy
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sagargupta16/Stock-market-prediction.git
cd Stock-market-prediction
```

2. Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook SMP.ipynb
```

## üìä Model Architecture

### LSTM Network Structure

- **Input Layer**: 6 features (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Average)
- **LSTM Layer**: 100 hidden units
- **Output Layer**: 1 unit (predicted closing price)
- **Sequence Length**: 5 days
- **Optimizer**: Adam with learning rate 0.001
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Fetching**: Historical stock data from Yahoo Finance (2020-2023)
2. **Feature Engineering**: Calculation of average price from high and low
3. **Normalization**: MinMaxScaler for feature scaling
4. **Sequence Creation**: Time series sequences for LSTM input
5. **Train/Test Split**: Last 30 days reserved for testing

## üìà Results and Analysis

### Stock Performance Metrics

The model evaluates performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) for each stock:

- **AAPL**: Apple Inc.
- **MSFT**: Microsoft Corporation
- **AMZN**: Amazon.com Inc.
- **TSLA**: Tesla Inc.

### Visualization Features

- **Price Prediction Charts**: Actual vs predicted prices comparison
- **Moving Averages**: 20-day and 50-day simple moving averages
- **Feature Importance**: Analysis of input feature contributions

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Running the Prediction Model

1. **Data Preparation**:

```python
# Fetch and preprocess stock data
data_aapl, scaler_aapl = fetch_preprocess('AAPL', '2020-01-01', '2023-01-01')
```

2. **Model Training**:

```python
# Train the LSTM model
model = LSTM()
# Training loop with 150 epochs
```

3. **Prediction and Evaluation**:

```python
# Evaluate model performance
actual_prices, predicted_prices = evaluate_model(test_sequences, scaler, model, 'AAPL')
```

### Customization Options

- **Stock Symbols**: Modify the stock symbols to analyze different companies
- **Date Range**: Adjust start and end dates for different time periods
- **Model Parameters**: Tune LSTM hidden layer size, sequence length, and learning rate
- **Training Epochs**: Modify the number of training iterations
